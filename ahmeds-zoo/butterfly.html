            Butterflies in the Amazon rainforest start their lives as tiny eggs on leaves.
            When they hatch, they become caterpillars and spend their time eating plants.
            Some caterpillars have bright colors to warn predators that they are poisonous.
            After growing big enough, the caterpillar forms a chrysalis and begins its transformation.
            Inside the chrysalis, it slowly changes into a beautiful butterfly.
            When it emerges, its wings are soft and wet, so it must wait before flying.
            Amazon butterflies come in many colors, like blue, orange, and yellow, to blend into the forest.
            They drink nectar from flowers and sometimes even sip minerals from wet soil.
            Many animals, like birds and frogs, try to eat butterflies, so they must be careful.
            Even though their lives are short, butterflies help pollinate plants and keep the rainforest healthy.
