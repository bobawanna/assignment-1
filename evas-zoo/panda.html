    The panda is a bear native to south-central China. It is easily recognized by the large,
    distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.
    The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda,
    a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the panda's diet is over 99% bamboo.
