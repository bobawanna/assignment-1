        Zebras are wild animals that look like horses with black and white stripes on their bodies. 
        They live in Africa and are known for their unique striped pattern, which helps them blend in with the grass.
        Zebras eat grass and live in groups called herds.Zebras are herbivores, meaning they only eat plants. 
        They communicate with each other through vocalizations, facial expressions, and body movement
